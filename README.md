📌 Situation:
AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing consumer electronics company with operations across multiple regions, relied heavily on Excel for reporting. This manual approach created visibility gaps in financial and operational performance, contributing to substantial losses, particularly in the LATAM region.

🎯 Task:
The objective was to develop a centralized, interactive reporting system to enhance decision-making, prevent further regional losses, and provide unified visibility across finance, sales, supply chain, and executive functions.

⚙️ Action:
I designed and developed a multi-layered Business Insights 360° dashboard using Power BI, integrating diverse business data to deliver actionable insights. Key features included:

Finance View: Interactive Profit & Loss statements segmented by customer, product, and region

Sales & Marketing View: Gross margin and profitability analysis across market segments

Supply Chain View: Forecast accuracy, error metrics, and supply risk profiling

Executive View: High-level KPIs and business health snapshot for leadership

Key techniques used:

Dynamic benchmarking (vs. LY and targets)

Drill-through capabilities for detailed analysis

Slicers and filters for custom views across users and departments

✅ Result:
Replaced fragmented Excel reports with an interactive, scalable BI solution. Improved visibility into underperforming SKUs and regions, enabling proactive decision-making and aligning business units under a single source of truth.
